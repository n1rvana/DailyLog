DailyLog
========

A daily log of what I did.

I noticed that when I've been working on public code for my open source project I
had a tendency to check github each day to make sure I'd done something that day.
But I'm spending a lot of time on parts of the project that aren't yet public, and
on some projects that are private repositories.  Since github doesn't log that work,
I wanted a way to "keep the chain" going... and as a bonus it's a daily diary of what
I've worked on so I can look back and see where I've been spending my time.  I don't
log everything I do, but the most significant thing I did that day, as the goal is
not to do makework every day but to move the ball forward in some way, each day.

Feel free to fork and tweak this, but if you do, please reset the log file for yourself. :-)

To use:
- Checkout the repo locally
- Add an alias to your profile: 
  alias log="cd ~/path/to/DailyLog/;./logger.sh"
- Then log each day:
  $ log "Today I wrote module X"

I hope nobody considers this an abuse of the github tracking system. I've seen people
check in repositories with automated post-dated commits to spell out their name in the 
grid and stuff like that.  This is much more in the spirit of the tracker, as you have
to run it every day.
